# Fashion-mnist-classifier
The objective is to build an artificial neural network (ANN) model capable of predicting whether a client is creditworthy or not, based on financial and demographic data, as well as traditional credit scoring data to predict the probability of loan repayment.
## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and statistics.
- Familiarity with neural networks (perceptrons and ANN).
- Python and TensorFlow/Keras installed.

## Dataset
Suggested data: German Credit Data (GCD) or Statlog (German Credit Data), a dataset commonly used to predict client creditworthiness using financial and personal attributes. This dataset is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features: The data includes 20 attributes, such as credit amount, duration, age, credit history, marital status, employment, etc. Classes: Two output classes: "creditworthy" (1) and "not creditworthy" (0).
